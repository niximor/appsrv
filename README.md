appsrv
======

Modern C++ application server to provide backend to your apps.

The server is currently in developement, it does not provide any functionality now. What it will be,
once it's finished, is backend server for C++/Python (and possibly others) applications.

It will provide generic framework for writing socket based applications with various handlers.

Each handler will be able to support different protocol and provide different functionality,
due to modular design.

It is written in modern C++14 programming language with strong focus on performance.
